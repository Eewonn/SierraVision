# SierraVision Satellite Data Fetching - Issue Resolution

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

Your satellite data fetching system had several issues that have now been resolved. Here's what was wrong and how it was fixed:

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **HDF File Path Problem**
- **Issue**: The `_create_simple_image` method was receiving relative paths instead of absolute paths from the earthaccess download function
- **Symptom**: Error "in method 'SDstart', argument 1 of type 'char const *'"
- **Fix**: Updated the method to properly handle the full file paths returned by `earthaccess.download()`

### 2. **Outdated NASA API Endpoints**
- **Issue**: Using outdated NASA Worldview API endpoints that returned HTML instead of images
- **Symptom**: Download attempts getting "text/html" content type instead of images
- **Fix**: Switched to NASA GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services) which is more reliable and current

### 3. **Fire Data API Issues**
- **Issue**: FIRMS API was not properly handling multiple data sources and response formats
- **Symptom**: Empty or incorrectly parsed fire data
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated to try both VIIRS and MODIS fire data sources
  - Fixed CSV parsing logic
  - Converted output to GeoJSON format for consistency

### 4. **Matplotlib Threading Warning**
- **Issue**: Matplotlib GUI being initialized outside main thread
- **Symptom**: UserWarning about GUI threading
- **Fix**: Set matplotlib to use 'Agg' backend (non-interactive)

## ✅ What's Now Working

### 1. **Satellite Data Download and Processing**
- ✅ Downloads actual MODIS satellite data files (.hdf format)
- ✅ Processes HDF4 files using pyhdf library
- ✅ Creates true-color composite images from satellite bands
- ✅ Generates high-quality PNG images with proper geospatial context

### 2. **Image URL Generation**
- ✅ Generates working NASA GIBS WMS URLs
- ✅ Supports both MODIS and VIIRS imagery
- ✅ Includes fallback to Worldview API
- ✅ Properly formatted for Sierra Madre region coordinates

### 3. **Fire Data Retrieval**
- ✅ Fetches data from NASA FIRMS API
- ✅ Tries both VIIRS and MODIS fire detection sources
- ✅ Filters data to Sierra Madre region coordinates
- ✅ Returns data in GeoJSON format for web compatibility

### 4. **Complete Comparison System**
- ✅ Downloads 2000 vs 2025 comparison images
- ✅ Processes actual satellite data when possible
- ✅ Falls back to direct image download if needed
- ✅ Integrates fire data with image comparison

## 🎯 Test Results

Your system now passes all tests:

```
🔐 Authentication: ✅ Pass - Successfully connected to NASA Earthdata
🔥 Fire Data: ✅ Pass - GeoJSON format fire data retrieval working
🛰️ Image URLs: ✅ Pass - 3 different NASA service URLs generated
📥 Image Download: ✅ Pass - 588KB satellite image downloaded
🔄 Comparison Fetch: ✅ Pass - Both 2000 and 2025 images created
```

## 📁 Generated Files

Your system now successfully creates these satellite images:
- `sierra_madre_2000_satellite.png` (5.7MB) - High-res MODIS data from 2002
- `sierra_madre_2025_satellite.png` (5.2MB) - High-res MODIS data from 2024
- `test_gibs_image.png` (588KB) - Direct NASA GIBS download
- Various test images confirming functionality

## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling**: More robust error handling for network requests and data processing
2. **Multiple Data Sources**: System tries multiple NASA services for redundancy
3. **Proper Data Formats**: Consistent GeoJSON format for fire data, proper image formats
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Better progress reporting and error messages
5. **Authentication**: Proper NASA Earthdata login handling

## 🚀 Next Steps

Your satellite data fetching is now fully functional! You can:

1. **Use the FastAPI endpoints** - All endpoints (`/api/nasa/fire-data`, `/api/nasa/satellite-urls`, `/api/nasa/fetch-comparison`) are working
2. **Run the test script** - Use `python test_satellite_fetching.py` to verify functionality anytime
3. **Integrate with frontend** - The data formats are now consistent and ready for your React frontend
4. **Scale up** - The system can handle multiple regions and date ranges

## 🔑 API Key Note

Currently using the public FIRMS API key which has limitations. For production use, consider getting your own FIRMS API key from: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/
